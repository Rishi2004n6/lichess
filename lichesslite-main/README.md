# lichesslite
Consider this my final project after finishing html and css. Used grid,flex and media queries and made my site responsive. I learnt a lot by cloning one of my favourite websites which is lichess.com. I can do a little better with fonts and their sizes. Also I can add some hower animations to some buttons here and there. 
My main motto is to practice page layouts and making it responsive. So didnt care much about trifles like fonts and hover animations. Maybe I'll add them when i get some free time.
Until then.. Peace.
